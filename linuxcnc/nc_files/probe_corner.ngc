; Edit 7xCNC June 2014 - Fixed Z probing plus annotation and documentation
; 
; UNTESTED CONCEPT edit for your use before trying
; for using probe to find corner and top of work and set this position as X0 Y0 Z0
; the idea is to make new set ups on a mill faster and more accurate with the use of a probe
; long version with many comments, MSGs, pauses, etc most moves with G38.n to protect probe and alert operator
; use to set X0Y0 as rear left corner of vise or lower left corner of workpiece
; set Z0 as top of vise or work at X Y location specified
; many moves are done with G91 Incremental mode, but on error or completion set back to G90 Absolute mode
 
; EXPLANATION
; This Subroutine finds a corner - lower left- and sets it to X0 Y0
; 
; Fast probe Y+, retract, then slow probe Y+ to find Y0
; Retracts, then moves along in X- direction by <Yinc>
; At each increment it does a fast probe in Y+ until encounters material, then retracts and moves along next increment
; If no material is encountered when moving Y+ within <Probedist> it begans to probe in X+ direction
; When it encounters material, it retracts in X-, then does a slow probe X+ to find X0
; <Ymax> sets a maximum distance it will try to probe along X- to find the corner, if the corner is not found within this distance it will stop and error
; Uses G92 to set X and Y axis at probe position minus radius of probe plus correction
; 
; Once X0Y0 is set, retracts Z up to <Zsafe>
; it travels to <Xcord><Ycord> to perform a Z probe to set Z0
; 
; finally moves to final coordinates <ZSafe> first, then <Xfin><Yfin>, then <Zfin>
;
; uses G92 to set Z at probe position plus correction
;
